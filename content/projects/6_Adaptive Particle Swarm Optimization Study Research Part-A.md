Comprehensive comparative analysis of Standard PSO vs novel Adaptive PSO (APSO) algorithm across the CEC2017 benchmark suite. Features dynamic parameter adjustment, stagnation detection, and reset mechanisms that consistently outperform standard PSO across 30 test functions in 10-100 dimensions. Includes innovative two-stage bin packing application and demonstrates 15-40% improvement in solution quality with enhanced scalability for complex optimization problems.
